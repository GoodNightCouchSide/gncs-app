## Installation

Before you get started make sure to have your local couchdb admin credentials (the ones that you
need to log into Fauxton CouchDB at http://localhost:5984/\_utils/#login) in place. For convenience
create the file .env in the project root and add your credentials as
COUCH_URL=http://admin:password@localhost:5984 there.

Clone the repo and run

```bash
npm install
```

Run the app via

```bash
npm start
```

and have fun on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

How to name your supporting branch prefixes?

## Code formatting and linting

To run the code formatting tool:

```bash
$ npm run format
```

This will cause [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to automatically fix any code correctness issues.

To run the linting checks:

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

This will not attempt any automatic fixes, which is preferable during test runs.

## Testing

We are planning to test our app with Jest
